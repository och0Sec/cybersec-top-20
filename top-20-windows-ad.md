# üöÄ Active Directory Penetration Testing Methodology

- **Pre-Engagement Preparation**: Define scope, objectives, rules of engagement; obtain authorizations; gather preliminary AD environment details.  
- **Reconnaissance**: Passive and active AD information gathering‚Äîidentify domain controllers, users, groups, GPOs, and network services.  
- **Enumeration & Scanning**: Leverage automated tools and manual scripts to enumerate objects, SPNs, ACLs, trusts, and policy settings.  
- **Exploitation**: Exploit weak credentials and misconfigurations via password spraying, Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, and relay attacks.  
- **Post-Exploitation**: Escalate privileges, maintain persistence, move laterally, and extract sensitive data (hashes, tickets, credentials).  
- **Reporting**: Document findings, attack chains, and provide prioritized remediation recommendations.
